By default deployed applications are visible only inside the Kubernetes cluster. Exposing our application externally will be covered in Module 4. To view the application output without exposing it externally, weâ€™ll create a route between our terminal and the Kubernetes cluster using a proxy:

`kubectl proxy`{{execute}}

We now have a connection between our host (the online terminal) and the Kubernetes cluster. The started proxy enables direct access to the API. The app runs inside a Pod (we'll cover the Pod concept in next module). 
Get the name of the Pod and store it in the POD_NAME environment variable:


`export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME`{{execute T2}}

To see the output of our application, run a curl request:

`curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/default/pods/$POD_NAME/`{{execute T2}}

The url is the route to the API of the Pod.

*Note: Check the top of the terminal. The last 2 commands were executed in a new tab (Terminal 2). The proxy still runs in the first tab, and this allowed our curl command to work using localhost.*
